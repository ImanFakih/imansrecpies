- 1.5 kg green beans, broken
- 200g beef filet, cut into bite-size pieces
- 4 tablespoons clarified butter, divided
- 2 onions, finely diced
- 6 garlic cloves, mashed
- 2 medium tomatoes, finely diced
- 1.5 cups chopped cilantro
- 1 lemon, juiced
- salt and black pepper

In a large pot over medium heat, fry beef in 2 tablespoons of clarified butter with salt and black pepper. Before they are completely cooked through, remove from pot and put aside.

Add remaining clarified butter to the pot, and fry onion with a pinch of salt over medium-low heat until soft. Add garlic and fry for a minute or two. Add tomatoes and cook until soft.

Add green beans and some salt. Close the pot and cook for at least 30 minutes, until the beans are mostly soft. Add back the beef and cilantro, then cook for another 5-10 minutes. 

Remove from heat and add lemon juice.

_Suggested flow: Break the green beans ahead of time. When starting to cook, first cut the beef. While beef is frying, chop the onion. While onion is cooking, mash the garlic and chop the tomatoes. While the entire dish is cooking for 30 minutes, juice the lemon and clean up the work space._
