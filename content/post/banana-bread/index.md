Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Prepare a Bundt pan.

- 2 cups mashed very ripe bananas (~6 large bananas)
- 4 eggs
- 2/3 cup butter, plus a little more to grease the pan

In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, eggs, and melted butter.

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus a little more for dusting the pan
- 1.5 cups white sugar
- 1/4 cup malted milk powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, malted milk powder, baking soda, and salt.

- 100g dark chocolate, chopped into chunks

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and combine well BUT GENTLY. Fold in the chocolate chunks.

Pour the batter into the pan.

Bake until the cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. (Test it with a toothpick at around 50 minutes.) Let it cool slightly in the pan, then use a butter knife to gently release the cake from the sides of the pan and around the inner circle, then flip it onto a plate.
