- 1 kg ground beef
- 7 garlic cloves, mashed
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 4 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon red chili pepper 

If the beef is lean, add fat to cover the bottom of a frying pan. Add beef and garlic. Fry until cooked through. Add rest of ingredients and fry for another couple of minutes.

_This can be eaten over rice (like the Yellow Maggi Rice), with a salad on the side. It can also be a poutine topping, or it can be rolled in a tortilla with fresh veggies and sour cream._
