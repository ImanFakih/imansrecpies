`Makes two 9' x 13' dishes and feeds around 6 people if served with rice.`

- 4 medium onions
- 4 red peppers
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 Tbsp coriander seeds, or
- 1/2 tsp salt

Peel and cut the onions width-wise in half then slice into 1cm thick slices. Cut the red peppers into thirds lengthwise then slice widthwise into 2cm thick slices.

Heat the oil in a large saut√© pan. Add the onions and coriander seeds, and cook on medium heat for three minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the peppers and cook for five minutes.

- 6 tomatoes, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 4 bay leaves
- 3 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 cup white vinegar

In the meantime, chop the tomatoes and mash the garlic. Add the tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, curry powder, and salt to the pan and cook for eight minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the sugar, vinegar, and cook for a couple of minutes.

- Ghee for frying
- 1 kg white fish
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs

Heat the remaining ghee in another frying pan. Dip the fish first in flour and then in egg, and fry for three minutes, turning once. Transfer the fish to the pepper pan so it's just coated by the vegetables and some liquid.

- 1 cup chopped cilantro

Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the fish is cooked, then remove and leave to come to room temperature. The fish can be served at this point, but it's better after a day or two in the fridge. Serve garnished with coriander.
