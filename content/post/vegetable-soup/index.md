_**Chicken stock**_

- 2 chicken thighs
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 onion
- 1 tablespoon salt

Place chicken in a large pot and fill it halfway with water. Put pot on high heat for around 15 minutes until foam starts to appear and skim it off. Once foam is skimmed, add cinnamon stick, bay leaves, salt. Cut onion into quarters and add it to the pot. Bring water to a boil, then dial heat to low and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.

Move chicken from pot to plate and shred it. If using one pot, transfer chicken stock to a bowl.

Chop celery very fine by hand or using the food processor. Heat olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add celery with a sprinkle of salt. Cover and cook for around 7 minutes, until very soft.
