- 200g beef filet, cut into bite-size pieces

In a large pot over medium heat, fry beef in the clarified butter with salt and black pepper. Before they are completely cooked through, remove from pot and put aside.

- 2 Tbsp clarified butter
- 2 onions
- 6 garlic cloves
- 2 medium tomatoes
- 1.5 kg green beans, broken and ends discarded

Finely dice the onion. Cook it in the clarified butter with a pinch of salt over medium-low heat until soft. In the meantime, mash the garlic and finely dice the tomatoes. Add the garlic to the onions and fry for a minute or two. Add the diced tomatoes and cook until soft. Add green beans and some salt. Close the pot and cook for at least 30 minutes, until the beans are mostly soft.
