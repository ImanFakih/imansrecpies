`Makes a 9-inch cake`

- 1/2 cup (110g) butter

Take the butter out of the fridge. Preheat the oven to 325°F/160°C. Prepare a 9-inch cake pan.

- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, or a mixture of all-purpose and whole wheat
- 1 Tbsp ground cardamom
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp vanilla powder
- ¼ tsp salt

When the butter is soft but still relatively cold, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl using a whisk. Use a hand-mixer or food processor to incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks uniform.

- 1 cup (340g) honey, or a mix of honey and sugar by weight
- 2 eggs
- ¾ cup (245g) sour cream or yogurt

In a smaller bowl, mix the wet ingredients. Slowly add the wet ingredients into the flour and butter mixture until well-combined.

Transfer the batter to the cake pan and bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan on the counter for 10 minutes or so. Then turn out the cake onto a rack and let it cool completely.
