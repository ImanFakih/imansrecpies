`These will keep in an airtight container for several days. `

1/2 cup packed brown sugar (110g)
1/4 cup granulated sugar (50g)
2 teaspons Maldon (flaky sea) salt _(when making for family use 1 tsp)_
1/2 cup + 2 TBSP cultured, unsalted butter (140g)
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp vanilla extract

1. Get egg out of fridge. Place chocolate in fridge.
2. Preheat oven to 375oF.
3. In a large bowl whisk the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and salt to combine
4. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Whisk gently and consistently, cooking the butter as it foams. Remove from heat when the foam begins to subside and the butter starts to brown and smell nutty, about 6 minutes in total.
5. Pour the butter intp the bowl with the sugars amd whisk to combine well. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Once the butter and sugar mixture feels lukewarm, whisk in the egg, followed by the baking soda and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

1 1/4 cup all purpose flour (170g)
1 cup (185g) chocolate chips, chilled _(use a little less, maybe 170g)_

7. Next, use a spatula or wooden sppon to stir in the flour until well-combined. The consistency should be thick by spoonable; if it feels too runny, refirgerate for 15-30 minutes to firm up. Use a spatula to stir in the chocolate chips, making sure they are well distributed throughout.

Scoop or spoon 12 balls of batter (2 TBSP or 60g each) onto the parchment -lined baking sheet (the dough will spread out as it bakes) laying out 3 rows of 4 cookies.

Bake until golden and semi-firm around the edges, but still very soft in the center, about 12-13 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
