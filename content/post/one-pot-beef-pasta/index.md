- 250g beef
- 2 Tbsp ghee/butter/oil
- 1 tsp cinnamon powder
- 0.5-1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp dried parsley (optional)
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste

Melt ghee in a large pot over high heat. Add beef, cinnamon, black pepper, and a sprinkle of salt. Stir for a minute. Add the tomato paste. Stir for a couple of minutes.

- 250g small pasta
- Water 2x pasta volume
- 1.5 tsp salt

Add the pasta, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Cover the pot and simmer for 10-15 minutes stirring every few minutes to prevent it from sticking to the pot. Turn off the heat when the pasta is completely cooked with just enough sauce covering it. If it looks drier than you like, add a splash of water.
