- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 1/2 cups long-grain or Basmati rice
- 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

(1) Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven.

(2) Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.

(4) Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

(5) Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. 

(6) Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing.

(7) Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
